They are set to publically accessible to 'Anyone' with link can view this.

It is in a zipped folder. After moving it here, unzip.

If you want to run the code that uses these fine-tuned pretrained models (for inference),
they need to be moved to the task3 folder.
The expected path is `saved_models_t3/pretrained_finetuned/sm_1` and sm_2, for sampling method 1 or 2.
Loading a model is hardcoded to read the sm_1 model (but can be changed by manually editing the path in
function `load_finetuned_vit_for_inference_only()` in task3/task3_helper_functions.py)
